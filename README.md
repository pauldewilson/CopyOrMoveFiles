This script asks the user whether they want to:
<ol>
<li>Copy
<li>Move
</ol>

Files from either

<ol>
<li>An entire directory
<li>A specific list
</ol>
NOTE: It presently works fine however it's V0.9 due to time constraints.<br>No validation is performed on whether 
the text file of specific files actually contains valid filenames.
